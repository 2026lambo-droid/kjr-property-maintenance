# Image assets – commercial property maintenance only

All images used by the site are defined in `src/config/images.js`. **Containers, sizes, aspect ratios, positions, and spacing stay the same**; only the image **content** (the actual photo/graphic) should be replaced.

## Content rules

- **Include:** Commercial buildings, maintenance crews, pressure washing, parking lot sweeping, graffiti removal, junk removal, day porter services.
- **Exclude:** Residential imagery, tree services, landscaping.
- **Style:** Realistic, professional photos; evening or clean commercial tones where appropriate.

## Files to replace (in `public/assets/img/`)

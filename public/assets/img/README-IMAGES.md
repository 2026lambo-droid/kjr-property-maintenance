# Image assets – KJR Property Maintenance

Use only property-maintenance imagery: commercial buildings, day porter, parking lot sweeping, pressure washing, graffiti removal, junk removal. No residential, tree, or landscaping.

## Pressure washing sections

**Required:** All pressure washing sections must use **pressure washing imagery only** (e.g. power washing equipment, floor scrubbing, exterior washing). **Do not use window cleaning photos** for these assets.

- **pressure_washing.png** – Used for: pressure washing service page hero, Services page pressure washing card, home pressure washing card, gallery, project thumbs.
- **pressure_washing_2.png** – Used for: pressure washing service page “Request a Quote” block (CTA).

If either file currently shows a window cleaner, replace the file with a pressure washing / power washing image (same filename) so the site shows the correct service.

## Parking lot sweeping

The site uses **parking_lot_sweeping.png** for all parking lot sweeping sections (service cards, detail page, gallery, project thumbs). Replace that file to update the imagery.
